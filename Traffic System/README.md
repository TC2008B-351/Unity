# Unity Traffic System

This project defines the behavior of a traffic agent in an Unity simulation. It uses a Mesa implementation on a Flask server to model the agent's decision-making process. The Mesa models and agents provides this unity project with the following steps each car must follow, while the Flask server allows the agent to receive information from the simulation about the environment and next steps to take.
